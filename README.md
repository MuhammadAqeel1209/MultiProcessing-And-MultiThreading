# MultiProcessing-And-MultiThreading

A project demonstrating the concepts of multiprocessing and multithreading in Python, focusing on efficient task execution and resource management. This repository showcases examples, use cases, and performance comparisons between these two concurrency paradigms.

---

## 📚 **Overview**

This project includes:

- **Multithreading**: Handling I/O-bound tasks, where threads share the same memory space.
- **Multiprocessing**: Managing CPU-bound tasks with separate memory spaces for better performance.

---

## 🚀 **Features**

- Clear examples demonstrating threading and multiprocessing.
- Performance analysis with detailed metrics.
- Real-world use cases:
  - File handling
  - Web scraping
  - Data processing
- Comparison between threading and multiprocessing for specific scenarios.

---

## 🔧 **Technologies Used**

- **Python 3.x**: Core programming language.
- Libraries:
  - `threading`
  - `multiprocessing`
  - `concurrent.futures`

---

## 🛠️ **Installation**

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MuhammadAqeel1209/MultiProcessing-And-MultiThreading
   ```
